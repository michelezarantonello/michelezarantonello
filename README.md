## About Me

I am a Control Systems Engineering student with a strong background in computer science.  
I'm passionate about **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **computer vision**, and both **mobile and industrial robotics**.  
I am also experienced in the design and implementation of **advanced control systems** such as PID and LQR controllers.

I am particularly motivated by the intersection between robotics, artificial intelligence and control theory aiming to develop intelligent and autonomous systems capable of adapting to complex environments.
